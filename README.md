## Project Information:

This project focuses on HR data analytics, utilizing a dataset of employee information. I employed Power BI to extract key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

- Employee Count
- Attrition Count
- Attrition Rate
- Active Employees
- Average Age

The findings are visually presented through charts, highlighting:

- Attrition by Gender
- Department-wise Attrition
- Number of Employees by Age Group
- Job Satisfaction Ratings
- Education Field-wise Attrition
- Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups.

Testing:

- The Values of the Dashboard are once again tested with the help of SQL queries through Microsoft SQL Server Management studio.
